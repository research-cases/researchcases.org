## Motives of the Republic of Letters

For the last 350 or so years we have relied on journals for the dissemination
of scholarly output. Yet journals were an addition to the communications method
at the time. The journal was a labor-saving device to distribute the latest
research news en masse to the public. As a communications medium, journals are
one-sided and lack the advantages of the method of scientific collaboration
that served as the precursor to the journal: correspondence by letter.

What was called the Republic of Letters was an international network of
philosophical collaborators during the 17th and 18th centuries. Letters were
exchanged between interested parties and were 

This happy looking chap, Antonie van Leeuwenhoek, is regarded by many as the
father of microbiology. He came upon a way to drastically improve the
magnification of a microscope and discovered bacteria among other things. He
published 0 papers or books, but used an open and effective method of
scientific communication and collaboration, writing over 560 letters to Henry
Oldenburg during the course of his life. Leeuwenhoek is widely regarded as an
amateur, and I believe that he would appreciate that designation, because he
did his research for the love of it and to satisfy his curiosity.

## Publish or Perish

If they had something that worked so well, correspondence by letter, what were
the motives for creating the journal?

Many of the early decisions to centralize scientific communications were driven
simply by economics. It was cheaper to scale using the printing press rather
than employing an army of copyists.

In early 1665 Henry Oldenburg somehow obtained a copy of the newly published
Journal des sçavans. He came up with a business idea. If he was able to create
a journal entirely devoted to natural philosophy (or science), he would be able
to promote the new ideas, broaden the reach of the Royal Society, and perhaps
even make a little bit of money on the side. It worked except for the money
part, though he made just enough to cover his rent.

While journals have been very successful at disseminating research, they have
also promoted an attitude of fierce competition and the social consequent:
*publish or perish*. The printing process has entrenched the subtle yet
devastating ideas that research must be finished before it is shared and that
peer review is a one-time ordeal. The commercialization of the research and
journal publication industries has only exacerbated the problem.

The economics of the journal led to an environment of centralization, where
papers were funneled through the publisher. Eventually, the economics of the
machine won. It was more efficient to disseminate scientific news to a broad
audience using the printing press than to keep up a one-to-one direct style of
interaction. Notoriety also played a part in this, as researchers sought to be
published, become famous, and secure opportunities for future funding.
Publishers became the de facto gatekeepers of knowledge, and the orchestrators
of peer review.

Where has this led us?

* A funding model that is tied to the publishing process, to which researchers
  are slaves.
* Publishing overhead.
* Researchers have become silos themselves to protect their own interests.
* A frenetic drive to climb to the top.

## Research Cases

What can we learn from those early days of scientific correspondence? How can
we superimpose our modern technology on the motives that drove members of the
Republic of Letters to collaborate so eagerly?

Couldn't we create something even more valuable because we have technology that
they didn't? Technology that will allow us to collaborate economically in more
direct ways?

Who is going to do it? As researchers, we're trapped in the current system and
publishers are more-or-less happy with the status quo.

As a social business, one of our goals is to lower the barriers for people of
all disciplines, subjects, and skill levels to be able to contribute to
knowledge creation in meaningful ways.

We envision the future of research being based upon open Web standards and
collaboration platforms.

The Republic of Letters has already succeeded. We're building on principles
that work!

Research should not be a rat race. We need to reward researchers for building
quality collaborations. Researchers that create great collaborations will
accomplish more and should be promoted.

Funding

If all we needed was a modern version of correspondence, wouldn't mailing lists
have taken over the role by now?

Blogs and wikis are good at disseminating content, so why haven't they replaced
the journal already? Obviously, it is because the journal is not enough. The
dissemination of content is not valuable enough in its own right to warrant
widespread change. As a research community, we're missing something important.
Something that we've lost. Something that is worth changing for, something that
would accelerate research like nothing else would.

Never before in the history of our World has knowledge and enlightenment been
so freely available to all. Never before have so many joined the ranks of the
curious. Yet while they want to participate in the creation of knowledge,
modern-day researchers don’t want to jump through the crusty hoops of
traditional journal publishers anymore. Journals are just not the labor-saving
device they used to be, and the Republic of Letters has long since collapsed.
Happily, the World Wide Web offers us hope and so many more possibilities.

Research cases is a vision for a new kind of research—a research that is more
collaborative, similar in spirit to the network of correspondence that existed
during the 17th and 18th centuries.

* Quasi-informal, open, in-process research
* Real Collaboration
* Low barrier of entry - Bring in all "curious" people
* Rapidity of interaction
* Flexible
* Distributed
* Diversity of approaches. Get away from the monoculture of the journal.
* Smart peer review
* Own your research. Research is not a paper.
* Disseminate how you want to
* Control your research and your publications.
* More participatory. Get out of the ivory tower.

VCs promote the businesses they have invested in. Do journals do the same?

Elitism. Who among us knows all there is to know? There is always someone
smarter than you. No one person can act as an arbitrator anymore. Computers
should be able to find the experts of a certain topic, the best people to
review the given research.

Science has taught us, if anything, that we don't always have things right the
first time. ;)
