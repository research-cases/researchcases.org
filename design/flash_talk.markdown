## Republic of Letters

Antonie van Leeuwenhoek

For the last 350 or so years we have relied on journals for the dissemination
of scholarly output. Yet journals were a hack—a labor-saving device to
distribute the latest research news en masse to the public. As a communications
medium, journals are one-sided and lack the advantages of the method of
scientific collaboration that served as the precursor to the journal:
correspondence by letter.

Andrea Rusnock said,

> Unlike weekly meetings of the [Royal] Society, correspondence allowed
> geographically remote individuals to engage in, and with, the new sciences.
> While publication and distribution of the Philosophical Transactions
> certainly contributed to the diffusion of knowledge, it did not provide for
> the flexibility, openness, manoeuvrability and relative rapidity of
> interaction that correspondence did. In short, the Society’s correspondence
> encouraged a more participatory science.

While journals have been very successful at disseminating research, they have
also promoted an attitude of fierce competition and the social consequent:
*publish or perish*. The printing process has entrenched the subtle yet
devastating ideas that research must be finished before it is shared and that
peer review is a one-time ordeal. The commercialization of the research and
journal publication industries has only exacerbated the problem.

## Economic Drivers

In 1664 Henry Oldenburg had a business idea. Why did Henry start a journal?
What was he hoping to accomplish?

The economics of the journal led to an environment of centralization, where
papers were funneled through the publisher. Eventually, the economics of the
machine won. It was more efficient to disseminate scientific news to a broad
audience than to keep up a one-to-one style of communication. Notoriety also
played a part in this, as researchers sought to be published. Publishers became
the de facto gatekeepers of knowledge, and the orchestrators of peer review.

## Research Cases

What can we learn from those early days of scientific correspondence? How can
we superimpose our modern technology on the motives that drove members of the
Republic of Letters to collaborate so eagerly?

If all we needed was a modern version of correspondence, wouldn't mailing lists
have taken over the role by now?

Blogs and wikis are good at disseminating content, so why haven't they replaced
the journal already? Obviously, it is because the journal is not enough. The
dissemination of content is not valuable enough in its own right to warrant
widespread change. As a research community, we're missing something important.
Something that we've lost. Something that is worth changing for, something that
would accelerate research like nothing else would.

Never before in the history of our World has knowledge and enlightenment been
so freely available to all. Never before have so many joined the ranks of the
curious. Yet while they want to participate in the creation of knowledge,
modern-day researchers don’t want to jump through the crusty hoops of
traditional journal publishers anymore. Journals are just not the labor-saving
device they used to be, and the Republic of Letters has long since collapsed.
Happily, the World Wide Web offers us hope and so many more possibilities.

Research cases is a vision for a new kind of research—a research that is more
collaborative, similar in spirit to the network of correspondence that existed
during the 17th and 18th centuries.

* Quasi-informal, open, in-process research
* Real Collaboration
* Low barrier of entry - Bring in all "curious" people
* Rapidity of interaction
* Flexible
* Distributed
* Diversity of approaches. Get away from the monoculture of the journal.
* Smart peer review
* Own your research. Research is not a paper.
* Disseminate how you want to
* Control your research and your publications.
* More participatory. Get out of the ivory tower.

VCs promote the businesses they have invested in. Do journals do the same?

Elitism. Who among us knows all there is to know? There is always someone
smarter than you. No one person can act as an arbitrator anymore. Computers
should be able to find the experts of a certain topic, the best people to
review the given research.

Science has taught us, if anything, that we don't always have things right the
first time. ;)
