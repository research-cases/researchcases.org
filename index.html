Nor is it prose, though it is just as meticulously crafted. Most definitely, research is a creative process, though it has more to do with <a href="https://ia.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/">information design than typography</a>. Research is <a href=http://researchobject.org>more than a container for publication</a>—it has a well-defined, natural structure leading from a Question to an Answer.</p><div class=nav-background><div class=nav-wrapper><nav><ul><li><a href=#motivations data-scroll>Motivations</a></li><li><a href=#exposition data-scroll>Exposition</a></li><li><a href=#community data-scroll>Community</a></li><li><a href="http://pentandra.com/spec/research-cases/">Spec</a></li></ul></nav></div></div></section></div><section id=motivations><h2>Motivations</h2><p class=central>For the last 350 or so years we have relied on journals for the dissemination of scholarly output. Yet journals were a hack—a labor-saving device to distribute the latest research news en masse to the public. As a communications medium, journals are one-sided and lack the advantages of interaction and collaboration of the prevalent mode of discourse at the time: <em>correspondence by letter</em>.</p><div class=full><figure id=philtrans class=leftnarrow><img class=right src=/images/8b5f04cd.Philosophical_Transactions_Volume_1_frontispiece_500px.jpg alt="The frontispiece of the first volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society"><figcaption class="caption-left left">The frontispiece to the first volume of the Philosophical Transactions of the Royal Society, one of the first scientific journals.</figcaption></figure><div class=rightwide><blockquote lang=en-GB cite=http://www.jstor.org/stable/4028081><p>Unlike weekly meetings of the <span class=normal>[Royal]</span> Society, correspondence allowed geographically remote individuals to engage in, and with, the new sciences. While publication and distribution of the Philosophical Transactions certainly contributed to the diffusion of knowledge, it did not provide for the flexibility, openness, manoeuvrability and relative rapidity of interaction that correspondence did. In short, the Society’s correspondence encouraged a more participatory science.</p></blockquote><p class=small>— Andrea Rusnock, from <cite>The British Journal for the History of Science</cite>, June 1999, p. 156.</p></div></div><p class=central>While journals have been very successful at disseminating research, they have also promoted an attitude of fierce competition and the social consequent of <em>publish or perish</em>. The printing process has entrenched the subtle yet devastating ideas that research must be finished before it is shared and that peer review is a one-time ordeal. The commercialization of the research and journal publication industries has only exacerbated the problem.</p><p class=central>On the other hand, never before in the history of our World has knowledge and enlightenment been so freely available to all. Never before have so many joined the ranks of the <i>curious</i>. Yet while they want to participate in the creation of knowledge, modern-day researchers shouldn’t need to jump through the hoops of traditional journal publishers anymore. Journals are just not the labor-saving device they used to be, and the <a href=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Letters>Republic of Letters</a> has long since collapsed. Happily, the World Wide Web offers us hope and <em>so many more possibilities</em>.</p><!-- Where do I put this idea?

Even when you’re doing <a href=http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Exploratory_research>exploratory research</a>, sifting through data trying to make sense of it, you’re ultimately trying to get to a question that you can answer. Refinements to the research question are important to retain, and are preserved as part of the research case.</p></div></div><div class=full><figure class=leftwide><figcaption class="caption-left left">Research (ideally) leads a researcher from a Question to an Answer.</figcaption><img class=right src=/images/c5e020aa.researchcase_question_and_answer.svg alt="A research case with a question and an answer"></figure><div class=rightnarrow><p>The purpose of the research case is to track the journey the researcher took in finding an answer to that question. A research case represents an explicit scope for research—a focused effort to discover a truth, an answer to a specific question.</p></div></div><div class=full><figure class=leftwider><figcaption class="caption-left left">Answers evolve over time and are an explicit representation of the progress of research.</figcaption><img class=right src=/images/25096078.researchcase_question_and_multiple_answers.svg alt="A research case with a question and multiple answers"></figure><div class=rightaside><p>In a research case, sources of pertinent data are aggregated. Information within those sources is used as evidence to support specific answers to the question. Questions, evidence, and answers are based on domain-specific vocabularies, structured with chains of arguments and evidence. Answers evolve over time as more evidence comes to light, but the questions stay the same. Prior answers are retained and may conflict.</p></div></div><p class=central>As research progresses, more questions arise. Each of these questions represents a distinct research case. Answers from one research case can be used as evidence in other research cases.</p><figure class=full><img src=/images/b82752eb.researchcase_process.svg alt="The research process modeled as research cases"></figure><div class=central><p>Research cases let us see the traditional scholarly paper in its true light. It becomes clear that the paper only describes the highlights of your research and is not the research itself. Research cases change the way that research is shared. Instead of sharing news of your research via a journal article (and of course waiting until after it is written, reviewed, and published), research cases enable the research itself to be shared in an understandable, open way, bit by bit as you go along.</p><p>This approach has huge implications for transparency and reproducibility, as well as making it easier for others to build on your work, and for you to build on the work of others.</p><p>Research cases are a uniform approach to research on the Web that works from simple questions and answers to complicated, evidence-supported scientific breakthroughs. Research cases preserve the context and process of research across tools, researchers, and disciplines. They’re designed for humans first, machines second.</p><p>For technical details, see the <a href="http://pentandra.com/spec/research-cases/">current draft</a> of the specification.</p></div></section><section id=community><h2>Community</h2><div class=central><p>Here’s what to do if you want to help:</p><ol><li>Join the <a href="https://groups.pentandra.com/groups/research-cases/">Research Cases Group</a>.</li><li>Check out Research Cases <a href=https://github.com/research-cases>on GitHub</a>.</li><li>For bonus points, introduce yourself to the group and give feedback!</li></ol></div><div class=full><section id=publications class=rightwider><h3>Presentations & Publications</h3><ul><li>{K. &amp; C.} Chapman, <a href=http://2015.noise-workshop.org/assets/papers/NoISE2015_10.pdf>Breaking the Paper Barrier and Publishing at the Speed of Thought</a>, presented at NoISE2015 Slovenia.</li><li>C.
