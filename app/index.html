          <p class="introduction">Research is not art. Nor is it prose, though
            it is just as meticulously crafted. Most definitely, research is a
            creative process, though it has more to do with <a
              href="https://ia.net/blog/the-web-is-all-about-typography-period/">information
              design than typography</a>. Research is <a
              href="http://researchobject.org">more than a container</a> for
            publication—it has a well-defined, natural structure leading from a
            Question to an Answer.</p>

        <p class="central">For the last 350 or so years we have relied on
          journals for the dissemination of scholarly output. Yet journals were
          a hack—a labor-saving device to distribute the latest research news
          en masse to the public. As a communications medium, journals are
          one-sided and lack the advantages of the method of scientific
          collaboration in use before outset of the journal: <em>correspondence
            by letter</em>.</p>

              The frontispiece to the first volume of the Philosophical
              Transactions of the Royal Society, one of the first scientific
              journals.

                meetings of the <span class="normal">[Royal]</span> Society,
                correspondence allowed geographically remote individuals to
                engage in, and with, the new sciences. While publication and
                distribution of the Philosophical Transactions certainly
                contributed to the diffusion of knowledge, it did not provide
                for the flexibility, openness, manoeuvrability and relative
                rapidity of interaction that correspondence did. In short, the
                Society’s correspondence encouraged a more participatory
                science.</p></blockquote>

        <p class="central">While journals have been very successful at
          disseminating research, they have also promoted an attitude of fierce
          competition and the social consequent of <em>publish or perish</em>.
          The printing process has entrenched the subtle yet devastating ideas
          that research must be finished before it is shared and that peer
          review is a one-time ordeal. The commercialization of the research
          and journal publication industries has only exacerbated the
          problem.</p>
        
        <p class="central">On the other hand, never before in the history of
          our World has knowledge and enlightenment been so freely available to
          all. Never before have so many joined the ranks of the
          <i>curious</i>. Yet while they want to participate in the creation of
          knowledge, modern-day researchers shouldn’t need to jump through the
          hoops of traditional journal publishers anymore. Journals are just
          not the labor-saving device they used to be, and the <a
            href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Republic_of_Letters">Republic
            of Letters</a> has long since collapsed. Happily, the World Wide
          Web offers us hope and <em>so many more possibilities</em>.</p>

        <div class="central">

          <p>Research cases are a vision for a new kind of research—a research
            that is more participative, similar in spirit to the network of
            correspondence that existed during the 17th and 18th centuries.</p>

          <p>Research cases preserve the research context across tools,
            researchers, and disciplines. They are designed for humans first,
            machines second. Here’s a conceptual introduction.</p>

                research</a>, sifting through data looking for patterns, you’re
              still trying to get to a question that you can answer.
              Refinements to the research question are important to retain, and
              are published as part of the research case.</p>

        <div class="central">

          <p>Research cases do not, by themselves, add any domain-specific
            knowledge to the world. All of that knowledge is already there,
            and new knowledge is being created by domain experts and
            researchers every day. Research cases only change the way that
            research is shared. Research cases preserve the context and
            process of the research. Instead of sharing the latest research
            news via a journal article, research cases enable research itself
            to be shared in an understandable, open way.</p>

          <p>Research cases give us a new way to consider the traditional
            scholarly paper. In this context, the paper becomes a
            representation of the state of your research at a specific point in
            time. In contrast, research cases continue to evolve and are
            published incrementally over time.</p>

          <p>This approach has huge implications for transparency and
            reproducibility, as well as making it easier for others to build
            on your work, and for you to build on the work of others.</p>
